0.0.7 | 2024-02-23 14:26:19 +0100

  * Write: Use multiple streams by default, make configurable (Arne Welzel, Corelight)

    This is a bit of a mess, but the new test should show how to
    switch into single stream mode.

    It's overly configurable, but essentially supports single stream
    with a wildcard subject on the stream, or individual streams
    where the publish subject should agree with the stream subject.

    These aren't actually safe to be called from logging threads. Oh my.
